                <h4>Take your time!</h4>
                <p>When learning a new programming language it can be incredibly frustrating. I like everything to work the first time around, but that only happens in a perfect world unfortunately.
                    When learning to code, patience really is a virtue. I've learned to be patient with myself and to take my time and really understand each concept.
                    There is a lot to be said about going slowly in a world where everyone is going at a break neck speed. The greatest benefit to going at a slower pace is that it 
                    affords you the ability to really absorb the key concepts. It's best to know something well than to know various concepts on a surface level.
                </p>

                <h4>Be kind to yourself</h4>
                <p>This is a tough one for me. I put a lot of pressure on myself to get things done quickly and effeciently.
                    Learning to code is a brave endevour. It takes time to learn everything required to code proficiently.
                    I think everyone taking on a new skill and career deserves a pat on the back. Take time out for self care and 
                    to congratulate yourself for embarking on this new journey.
